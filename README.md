# Kairos — Landing Page

A small static marketing site for **Kairos**, an electional-astrology mobile app.
Four pages when complete: `index`, `terms`, `privacy`, and a styled `404`.

**Stack:** hand-coded semantic HTML + [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com)
compiled with a real build step. No framework, no React, no static-site generator.
Deployed on Vercel.

> Status: **P2 (Standard content sections)** complete. The floating pill nav and
> six content sections (`#what`, `#breadth`, `#ai`, `#pricing`, `#faq`, `#final`)
> render to hi-fi with the P2 copy deck's placeholder strings, plus the real
> OG/social-share image. Still stubs: the hero (P3) and the `#how` / `#features`
> showcases (P4). See [`docs/`](docs/) for the full plan and per-phase prompts.

## Commands

| Command             | What it does                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Compile CSS and watch for changes (Tailwind CLI, `--watch`)         |
| `npm run build`     | One-off minified CSS build → `site/css/main.css`                    |
| `npm run images`    | Run the image pipeline (see below). Add `-- --force` to regenerate. |
| `npm run favicons`  | Regenerate the favicon set + OG placeholder from the orrery mark.    |

There is no dev server. To preview locally, run `npm run dev` in one terminal and
serve `site/` with any static server, e.g. `cd site && python3 -m http.server`.
(Opening the HTML as a bare `file://` URL works but some rendering engines don't
apply the full stylesheet — serve over HTTP for an accurate preview.)

## Design tokens

The Orrery palette and the three type roles live in [`src/main.css`](src/main.css)
under `@theme` (Tailwind v4's CSS-first config — there is no `tailwind.config.js`).
Source of truth: `kairos-figma-handoff.html`. Colors are exposed as utilities
(`bg-bg`, `text-fg`, `bg-teal`, `border-hair`, …) and fonts as `font-display`
(Cormorant Garamond), `font-sans` (Space Grotesk), `font-data` (Space Mono).

Content max-width convention: **1080px**.

## Content model (how a CMS maps on later)

Every visitor-facing string carries a `data-content` label in dot-notation:
`data-content="<section>.<item>.<field>"`. This makes each string greppable by
name and gives a future headless CMS an obvious mapping — no code archaeology.

- **Repeating structures are strictly uniform.** Every nav link, footer link,
  legal section, and store badge uses identical markup, differing only in
  content. No one-off variants.
- **Attribute-bound copy is labeled too.** For `alt` / `aria-label`, add
  `data-content-attrs="alt"` (or `"aria-label"`) on the same element. For
  `<head>` meta and OG tags, a `<!-- content: meta.description -->` comment sits
  directly above the tag.
- **Shared components** (e.g. the store-badge block) are labeled once as a unit
  (`store-badges.app-store`) and reused verbatim, so the same label legitimately
  appears in more than one place (hero + footer today).

Examples:
`<a href="/#pricing" data-content="nav.links.pricing">Pricing</a>` ·
`<p data-content="footer.brand.descriptor">The Auspicious Moment</p>`.

Scaffolding-only text (the empty section-stub labels) uses a `_stub.*` namespace
and is replaced with real content in P2–P4.

## Shell (nav + footer) — keep in sync

There is no include mechanism yet (SSG is deferred), so the **nav and footer are
duplicated across all four pages**. Each shared block is wrapped in boundary
comments — `<!-- shell:nav (keep in sync across pages) -->` … `<!-- /shell:nav -->`
(same for `shell:head`, `shell:footer`). **Any edit to a shared block must be
applied to all four pages.** The only intended per-page differences: the `<head>`
title / description / OG fields, and the nav anchor hrefs (in-page `#what` on the
index vs. `/#what` on the other pages). When the SSG migration happens, these
blocks become a single partial.

## Store badges

The App Store / Google Play buttons are currently **clearly-marked placeholders**
(dashed border, a "placeholder" tag) — not the official artwork, which is
copyrighted and pending. They live in the reusable `store-badges` component; drop
the official Apple/Google SVG/PNG into each badge's inner slot to finalize.

## Fonts & icons

- **Fonts** are loaded from Google Fonts via `<link>` in each page's `<head>`
  (with `preconnect`) — not self-hosted. Three families: Cormorant Garamond
  (headlines), Space Grotesk (body), Space Mono (data/labels/eyebrows).
- **Icons** are [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/) (`@phosphor-icons/core`,
  a dev-only folder of raw SVGs). Convention: copy the needed icon's SVG markup
  **inline** into the HTML, use `fill="currentColor"`, and default to the **thin**
  weight (matches the editorial look). No icon font, no icon JS, no runtime
  dependency. Source SVGs: `node_modules/@phosphor-icons/core/assets/thin/`.

## Images

Raw masters live in `assets/masters/` and are the canonical source (the repo is
self-sufficient; the original `build-assets/` folder is no longer referenced).

`npm run images` reads the masters and writes optimized output to `site/img/`,
mirroring the folder structure:

- **Raster (PNG):** AVIF + WebP at widths `480 / 960 / 1440` (skipping widths
  larger than the source), plus an original-format fallback at the largest width.
  Naming: `<stem>-<width>.<ext>`.
- **SVG:** copied through unchanged.
- **Skipped:** `reference.png` files, `kairos-chart.html`, `MANIFEST.md`.
- Per-image overrides (widths / quality / skip) are configured at the top of
  [`scripts/images.mjs`](scripts/images.mjs). Defaults: AVIF q50, WebP q75.
- Idempotent: only regenerates when a master is newer than its output (or `--force`).

**The pipeline runs locally only — never on Vercel.** Its output (`site/img/`) is
committed to the repo. Consume images with a `<picture>` element (AVIF → WebP →
fallback); see `site/styleguide.html` for the pattern.

**Favicons** are generated separately by `npm run favicons`
([`scripts/favicons.mjs`](scripts/favicons.mjs)) from the orrery mark — the main
pipeline only does AVIF/WebP. Output (also committed): `site/img/favicon/`
(`favicon.svg`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon-180.png`). The favicon is a
simplified orbital mark derived from the orrery, because the full graphic is too
fine to read at 16–32px.

**OG / social-share image** (P2): master at `assets/masters/og/og-image.png`
(1200×630; Krea-generated orbital background + the wordmark composited locally),
run through the normal pipeline with a single-size override. Every page's
`og:image` points at the absolute production URL of
`site/img/og/og-image-1200.png`. The old `site/img/og-placeholder.png` from P0
is superseded.

## Deploy

Vercel is connected to this repo's GitHub remote. Every push to `main`
auto-deploys. Vercel runs `npm run build` (CSS compile only) and serves `site/`.
`cleanUrls` is on, so `/styleguide` resolves without the `.html`. Image
optimization is **not** part of the Vercel build — images are pre-generated and
committed.
